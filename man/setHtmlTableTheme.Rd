\arguments{
\item{theme}{A \code{list} containing all the styles or a \code{string} that is matched to some of the preset style (See details
below in the \emph{Theme options} section). \emph{Note}: the full name of the theme is not required as they are matched
using \code{\link[base:match.arg]{base::match.arg()}}.}

\item{align}{A character strings specifying column alignments, defaulting to \code{'c'}
to center. Valid chars for alignments are l = left, c = center and r = right. You can also specify
\code{align='c|c'} and other LaTeX tabular formatting. If you want to set the alignment of the
rownames this string needst to be \code{ncol(x) + 1}, otherwise it automatically
pads the string with a left alignment for the rownames.}

\item{align.header}{A character strings specifying alignment for column header,
defaulting to centered, i.e. \verb{[paste][base::paste](rep('c',ncol(x)),collapse='')}.}

\item{align.cgroup}{The justification of the \code{cgroups}}

\item{css.rgroup}{CSS style for the rgroup, if different styles are wanted for each of the
rgroups you can just specify a vector with the number of elements.}

\item{css.rgroup.sep}{The line between different rgroups. The line is set to the TR element
of the lower rgroup, i.e. you have to set the border-top/padding-top etc to a line with
the expected function. This is only used for rgroups that are printed. You can specify
different separators if you give a vector of rgroup - 1 length (this is since the first
rgroup doesn't have a separator).}

\item{css.tspanner}{The CSS style for the table spanner.}

\item{css.tspanner.sep}{The line between different spanners.}

\item{css.total}{The css of the total row if such is activated.}

\item{css.cell}{The css.cell element allows you to add any possible CSS style to your
table cells. See section below for details.}

\item{css.cgroup}{The same as \code{css.class} but for cgroup formatting.}

\item{css.header}{The header style, not including the cgroup style}

\item{css.header.border_bottom}{The header bottom-border style, e.g. \verb{border-bottom: 1px solid grey}}

\item{css.class}{The html CSS class for the table. This allows directing html
formatting through \href{http://www.w3schools.com/Css/}{CSS}
directly at all instances of that class. \emph{Note:} unfortunately the
CSS is frequently ignored by word processors. This option
is mostly inteded for web-presentations.}

\item{css.table}{You can specify the the style of the table-element using this parameter}

\item{pos.rowlabel}{Where the rowlabel should be positioned. This value can be \code{"top"},
\code{"bottom"}, \code{"header"}, or a integer between \code{1} and \code{nrow(cgroup) + 1}. The options
\code{"bottom"} and \code{"header"} are the same, where the row label is presented at the same level as
the header.}

\item{pos.caption}{Set to \code{"bottom"} to position a caption below the table
instead of the default of \code{"top"}.}

\item{col.rgroup}{Alternating colors (zebra striping/banded rows) for each \code{rgroup}; one or two colors
is recommended and will be recycled.}

\item{col.columns}{Alternating colors for each column.}

\item{padding.rgroup}{Generally two non-breakings spaces, i.e. \verb{&nbsp;&nbsp;}, but some
journals only have a bold face for the rgroup and leaves the subelements unindented.}

\item{padding.tspanner}{The table spanner is usually without padding but you may specify padding
similar to \code{padding.rgroup} and it will be added to all elements, including the rgroup elements.
This allows for a 3-level hierarchy if needed.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{list} with the new theme
}
\description{
The theme guides many of the non-data objects visual appearance. The
theme can be over-ridden by settings for each table. Too get a more complete
understanding of the options, see \code{\link[=addHtmlTableStyle]{addHtmlTableStyle()}}.
}
\section{Theme options}{


The styles available are:
\itemize{
\item \code{standard}: The traditional standard style used in \code{\link[=htmlTable]{htmlTable()}} since the early days
\item \verb{Google docs}: A style that is optimized for copy-pasting into documents on Google drive. This
is geared towards minimal padding and margins so that the table is as dense as possible.
\item \code{blank}: Just as the name suggests the style is completly empty in terms of CSS. Positions
for rowlabel and caption are set to \code{bottom} as these cannot be blank.
}

You can also provide your own style. Each style should be a names vector, e.g. \code{c(width = "100px", color = "red")}
or just a real css string, \verb{width: 100px; color: red;}.
